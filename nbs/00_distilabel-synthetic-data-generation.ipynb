    "## Customization Options\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides several parameters that can be modified to customize the synthetic data generation process for your specific use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Large Language Model (LLM) Selection\n",
    "- **Local Models**: Use `TransformersLLM` with different models:\n",
    "  - `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` (current)\n",
    "  - `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`\n",
    "  - `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`\n",
    "- **API Models**: Switch to `OpenAILLM` with models like:\n",
    "  - `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective)\n",
    "  - `gpt-4o` (higher quality)\n",
    "  - `gpt-3.5-turbo` (faster, cheaper)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LLM Generation Parameters\n",
    "- **temperature**: Controls randomness (0.1 = conservative, 1.0 = creative)\n",
    "- **max_new_tokens**: Maximum length of generated text (128-512 typical)\n",
    "- **top_p**: Nucleus sampling parameter for diversity control\n",
    "- **repetition_penalty**: Prevents repetitive text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. GenerateSentencePair Configuration\n",
    "- **hard_negative**: \n",
    "  - `False`: Generates easier negatives for stable training\n",
    "  - `True` (current): Creates harder negatives that are more challenging to distinguish\n",
    "- **action**: \n",
    "  - `\"paraphrase\"` (current): Focus on paraphrasing\n",
    "  - `\"semantically-similar\"`: More creative generation\n",
    "- **input_batch_size**: Adjust based on your hardware capabilities (1-50)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Prompt Engineering\n",
    "The `context` variable can be modified to:\n",
    "- Add industry-specific instructions\n",
    "- Include different negative generation strategies\n",
    "- Specify output format requirements\n",
    "- Add quality control guidelines\n",
    "- Target specific job domains or levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dataset Parameters\n",
    "- **num_examples**: Scale from 10 (demo) to thousands (production)\n",
    "- Chain multiple generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters allow you to fine-tune the generation process for different domains, quality requirements, and training objectives."
